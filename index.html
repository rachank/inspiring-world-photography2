                <p>Rachel Hankai</p>
                <br>
                <p> I was born in Canada, and am a lover of nature and all things outdoor adventure
                    related. Being in a lush green old growth forest, or on a cold, snow-covered mountain peak at
                    sunset, or
                    at the edge of a quiet still lake in the wilderness with the soft song of an early morning loon
                    coming through the mist, are all music to my soul. Even the simple fragrance of crisp fall leaves
                    crunching underfoot, can make the worst day so much better.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p> I am lucky to have had the opportunity to have travelled and lived in various parts of North
                    America and Europe. Along the way, I have taken whatever photography equipment that I could get my
                    hands on and tried to record and bring with me, the moments that I found most fascinating. I am also
                    an avid gardener and have had many adventures with mother nature and her ideas for what my garden
                    should look like, and I have tried to record her thoughts over the years. I have loved every minute
                    of it.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p> I have tried to capture those fleeting moments in nature that I have experienced, to be able to
                    share them with others and to have something wonderful to remind me of them all.
                    I hope you will also be able to appreciate some of these moments with me too.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p> Today, I am living in the Austrian Alps and continue to find new and momentary pauses in time that
                    capture my imagination and my camera to continue the journey of discovering the inspiring world
                    around us.
                </p>
