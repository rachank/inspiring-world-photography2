### Testing

* I tested this page to ensure that it functions on different browers: Chrome, Firefox, Safari.
* Note: I used Chrome on a mac to build the site.
* I used the devtools device toolbar to confirm that this site is respoinsive, looks good and functions correctly on all standard screen sizes.
* I confirmed that all links on the navigation tool bar are all ledgible and easy to understand.
* I have confirmed that the form works and requires entry into necessary fields and will only accept email in the email field and the submit button works.
* I have confirmed that the validation message is produced containing the header and footer along with a validation message to the user, once the submit button is pushed.


### Bugs

Solved bugs:

* I had problems seeing the social media icons and accidentally set the color to white on a white background. I fixed this by making the background black.
* I did not have an original page to validate the form, so created one.
* Had a 405 and 501 issue come up when the form was submitted and solved this by setting the method of POST to small letters instead of capitalized.
* Forgot to add comments in the HTML - so added them in.


### Validator Testing

* HTML
    * One error was returned - but deemed unimportant as section does have heading.

* Accessibility

    * Accessibility was fine, but performance was not good. Likely due to the larger sizes of the images so that they also apeareed very clear on larger screens.

* Unfixed Bugs

    * None - except for the performance of the site due to the larger sizes of the images - would try to adjust this in a future fix
